# Canvas API Grader - Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step testing examples based on real production usage, showing how to safely test and deploy the Canvas API grader system.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ installed
- UV package manager installed
- Canvas API token configured in `canvas_config.json`
- External grader script available (in separate UV environment)

## Testing Workflow Overview

```
1. Test UV wrapper in isolation
2. Find assignment ID for discussion
3. Test single student (dry-run)
4. Test single student (live)  
5. Full production grading
```

## Step 1: Test UV Wrapper System

First, test that the UV wrapper can execute your external grader properly:

```bash
# Create test input (replace with your actual data)
echo '{
  "student_name": "Test Student",
  "student_login": "testuser",
  "submission_text": "This is a test submission for grading.",
  "word_count": 8,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-09T01:22:00Z"
}' > test_submission.json

# Test the UV wrapper with debug output
UV_GRADER_DEBUG=1 ./uv_grader_wrapper.sh < test_submission.json
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[2025-09-09 01:22:32] DEBUG: Starting UV Grader Wrapper
[2025-09-09 01:22:32] DEBUG: Project path: /path/to/grader/project

[2025-09-09 01:22:33] DEBUG: Starting grader process
{
  "grade": "7",
  "comment": "Good response with detailed analysis...",
  "points": 7,
  "word_count": 8,
  "meets_word_count": false,
  "improvement_suggestions": [...]
}
[2025-09-09 01:22:40] DEBUG: Child process exited with code: 0
[2025-09-09 01:22:40] DEBUG: UV Grader Wrapper completed successfully
```

## Step 2: Find Assignment ID

Canvas discussions require assignment IDs for grade posting. Use the helper script:

```bash
python find_assignment_id.py 215770 2194470
```

**Output:**
```
2025-09-09 01:33:38,520 - INFO - Fetching discussion 2194470 from course 215770
Discussion: English as a Programming Language: Enhancing Usability and Practicality in Software Development
Discussion ID: 2194470
Assignment ID: 2459429

To run live grading for samanebk24:
python canvas_speedgrader.py \
    --course-id 215770 \
    --discussion-id 2194470 \
    --assignment-id 2459429 \
    --grader ./uv_grader_wrapper.sh \
    --only-student samanebk24 \
    --live \
    --output live_test_samanebk24.json
```

## Step 3: Single Student Testing (Dry Run)

Test with a single student first - this is the safest way to validate your setup:

```bash
python canvas_speedgrader.py \
    --course-id 215770 \
    --discussion-id 2194470 \
    --grader ./uv_grader_wrapper.sh \
    --only-student samanebk24 \
    --output test_single_student.json
```

**Output:**
```
=== DRY RUN MODE ===
Use --live flag to actually post grades and comments

Processed 1 total students:
  - 1 students with submissions (graded)
  - 0 students without submissions (skipped)

Students with submissions:

```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **DRY RUN MODE** - No grades posted to Canvas
- ✅ Single student processed safely
- ✅ Grader executed successfully
- ✅ Results saved to JSON for review

## Step 4: Single Student Testing (Live Mode)

Once dry run works, test live grading on a single student:

```bash
python canvas_speedgrader.py \
    --course-id 215770 \
    --discussion-id 2194470 \
    --assignment-id 2459429 \
    --grader ./uv_grader_wrapper.sh \
    --only-student samanebk24 \
    --live \
    --output live_test_samanebk24.json
```

**Output:**
```

## Step 5: Production Grading (Full Class)

Once single-student testing passes, run full class grading:

```bash
python canvas_speedgrader.py \
    --course-id 215770 \
    --discussion-id 2194470 \
    --assignment-id 2459429 \
    --grader ./uv_grader_wrapper.sh \
    --live \
    --output actual_grading_results.json
```

## Safety Features Demonstrated

### 1. Environment Isolation
- UV wrapper prevents dependency conflicts
- External grader runs in isolated environment
- No interference with main system

### 2. Progressive Testing
- Dry run before live mode
- Single student before full class
- Comprehensive logging at each step

### 3. Error Recovery
- Individual grading failures don't stop batch processing
- Clear success/failure indicators for each student
- Complete audit trail in JSON output

### 4. Privacy Protection
- Private submission comments instead of public replies
- No student data exposure in logs
- Secure credential handling

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: UV Environment Conflicts
```bash
# Solution: UV wrapper automatically handles this
unset VIRTUAL_ENV  # Done automatically by wrapper
```

### Issue: Assignment ID Not Found
```bash
# Solution: Use the helper script
python find_assignment_id.py <course_id> <discussion_id>
```

### Issue: Grader Timeout
```bash
# Check grader performance
UV_GRADER_DEBUG=1 ./uv_grader_wrapper.sh < test_submission.json
# Wrapper has 30-second timeout - ensure grader completes faster
```

## Production Deployment Checklist
