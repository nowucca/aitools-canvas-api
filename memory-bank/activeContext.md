# Canvas API Grader - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Recently Completed Major Milestone
**Project Modernization & Repository Setup**: Successfully converted the entire Canvas API grader project from traditional Python/pip to Python 3.12 + UV modern package management. The system is now production-ready with proper git version control and comprehensive documentation.

### Key Recent Changes

#### 1. UV Package Manager Migration
- **Converted from**: Traditional pip + requirements.txt setup  
- **Converted to**: Modern UV + pyproject.toml configuration
- **Result**: Faster dependency resolution, locked dependencies (uv.lock), and clean environment isolation

#### 2. UV Wrapper System Enhancement
- **File**: `uv_grader_wrapper.sh` - Production-ready shell wrapper with comprehensive signal handling
- **Key Features**: 
  - `unset VIRTUAL_ENV` to prevent environment conflicts
  - Foreground execution to preserve stdin/stdout communication  
  - Comprehensive error codes and debug logging
  - Proper cleanup on interruption

#### 3. Canvas Privacy & Safety Improvements
- **Privacy Enhancement**: Removed public discussion replies, now only posts private submission comments
- **Testing Safety**: Added `--only-student` parameter for safe single-student testing
- **Assignment Integration**: Proper assignment ID detection for grade posting via SpeedGrader

#### 4. Git Repository Organization
- **Comprehensive .gitignore**: Excludes sensitive configs, temporary files, virtual environments
- **Memory Bank Integration**: Added memory-bank/ directory while excluding construction/ folder
- **Clean Structure**: 13 core files staged and ready for version control

## Next Steps & Active Decisions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Commit Git Repository**: Complete the initial git commit with all staged files
2. **Test Production Workflow**: Validate end-to-end UV-based grading workflow
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensure README-uvgrader.md covers all use cases

### Active Technical Considerations

#### UV Environment Best Practices
- **Current Pattern**: `uv run python script.py` for all executions
- **Consideration**: Whether to add convenience scripts or maintain explicit UV commands
- **Decision**: Keep explicit UV commands for transparency and control

#### Canvas API Optimization
- **Current Approach**: Sequential student processing to respect rate limits
- **Future Consideration**: Batch API requests where Canvas API supports it
- **Decision**: Maintain sequential processing for reliability and simplicity

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Current Pattern**: Individual grading failures don't stop batch processing
- **Success Metrics**: System handles ~100 students reliably with comprehensive error reporting
- **Active Monitoring**: DEBUG level logging provides full audit trail

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Development Workflow Preferences
1. **Safety First**: Always default to dry-run mode, require explicit `--live` flag
2. **Testing Isolation**: Use `--only-student` extensively during development
3. **Environment Isolation**: Always use UV wrapper for external grader execution
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: DEBUG mode provides full visibility into system operations

### Code Quality Standards
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential libraries (`requests` only currently)
- **Clear Separation**: Canvas API, grader communication, and business logic in separate concerns
- **Error Transparency**: Failures provide actionable error messages
- **Resource Management**: Explicit cleanup of processes, files, and connections

### Operational Patterns
- **Configuration Management**: Separate config files (canvas_config.json) with examples
- **Version Control**: Exclude sensitive data, temporary files, and build artifacts
- **Documentation**: Maintain both traditional README.md and UV-specific README-uvgrader.md

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Technical Insights
1. **UV Environment Conflicts**: The `unset VIRTUAL_ENV` solution was critical - discovered that existing virtual environments interfere with UV execution
2. **Canvas Assignment Discovery**: Discussion IDs ≠ Assignment IDs - need separate lookup via `find_assignment_id.py`
3. **Privacy Requirements**: Educational contexts require private feedback, not public discussion replies
4. **JSON Communication**: Stdin/stdout JSON protocol works excellently for grader isolation

### Integration Challenges Solved
1. **Process Management**: Shell wrapper provides robust process lifecycle management
2. **API Rate Limits**: Sequential processing with proper timeouts prevents throttling
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation allows partial success in batch operations
4. **Development Safety**: Dry-run and single-student modes enable safe iteration

### Production Readiness Achievements
- **Dependency Management**: UV provides reproducible, fast environment setup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with structured logging  
- **Security**: Proper credential isolation and input validation
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and minimal external dependencies
- **Testability**: Multiple testing modes from single-student to full batch processing

## Current System Status
- **Environment**: Python 3.12 + UV package manager ✅
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (`requests` only) ✅
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README files ✅
- **Version Control**: Git repository with proper exclusions ✅
- **Testing**: Dry-run and single-student modes ✅
- **Production**: Live grading successfully tested ✅
- **Memory Bank**: Complete documentation of system architecture ✅

The system is ready for production use and ongoing development with a solid foundation for future enhancements.
